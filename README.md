Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Is engineering branch that deals with designing, developing, testinf and maintanance of software applications such as website.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering is systematic and follows all the stages of software development lifestyle  ans uses structured methodologies such as agile and waterfall while traditional programming focuses on writing a code and solving the current problem without following proper planning processes. Bala (2018) stated that popular processes such as planning, analysis, design, implementation, and support are used in the traditional programming while there is no clear flow from the design phase to the implementation phase, instead, it uses cases and diagrams. Bala further stated that the traditional programming depends on the size and type of the project while the software engineering depends on the complexity of the project and the experience of team members. 

The traditional programming is non-iterative and produces a document at the end of a single phase while the software engineering is highly iterative and may or may not produce a document at the end of a single phase (Singh & Malhotra, 2012). Software engineering ensures that testing and quality assurance is performed through out the development process while in traditional programming testing is informal, the focus is on resolving the issue at hand. Quality and reliability on traditional programming is compromised as compared to software engineering.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

The System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) consists of 5 stages as follows: 

1.  Project planning phase 
In this phase, the problem is identified, and there is planning and monitoring of the project.  
The project should be feasible and develop a schedule as well as a resource plan. A 
project should have a budget for the entire project. The planning phase is the most 
important stage for the success of a project.  This phase involves the Information 
Technology (IT) department as it plays a crucial role in business planning. (Satzinger, et 
al., 2009 & Tilley, 2020). 
The phase involves five activities: Defining the problem, is important to define the problem 
in the business that requires a solution and identify the major uses of the system. Project 
schedule, the project team or analysts create a schedule that states tasks, activities, and 
milestones that need to be achieved in the given project life cycle. This helps in time and 
progress management. To confirm the feasibility of the project, it is important to check if 
the project is doable by evaluating technical feasibility and resource availability, and other 
necessary factors. Staff the project, a team is assigned based on the skills and knowledge 
they possess. Project launch, the software is designed and installed and then made 
available for end users (Satzinger, et al., 2009).

2. Analysis phase 
The main objective of the stage is to have a detailed understanding of the project or new 
system, importantly the problem. A logical model of the new system is built. The team 
must investigate the business processes and document the purpose of the system. 
Research must be conducted through interviews and surveys to understand the system 
(Satzinger, et al., 2009 & Tilley, 2020). 

According to Satzinger, et al. ( 2009), the analysis phase consists of six activities  
Gather information – collection of relevant information about the problem that occurs and 
conducting an investigation to get as much information as possible. 
Define system requirements – documentation of system requirements takes place as well 
as stating possible constraints of the project. 
Build prototypes for the discovery of requirements – prototypes of the new system are 
built for users to review. 
Prioritize requirements – this helps in identifying important requirements and ensuring 
they are attended to first.  
Generate and evaluate alternatives – other alternatives for implementing the project are 
identified. 
Review recommendations with management – before continuing with the project, the 
team involved recommends an alternative to management. 

3. Design phase 
A solution is designed based on the requirements stated and decisions taken during the 
analysis phase. There are two types of designs, High-level design which consists of the 
development of the architectural structure of the software, and low-level design which 
consists of algorithms and data structures for software development. The design is 
presented to management for approval and management intervention is important to 
avoid misunderstandings of the purpose of the new system, how it will work and the costs 
involved (Satzinger, et al., 2009 & Tilley, 2020). 
According to Satzinger, et al. ( 2009), there are seven activities involved:  
Design and integrate the network – network infrastructure is designed and network 
environment and protocols is determined.  
Design the application architecture – the structure and organization of the software is 
designed through the section of relevant technologies and patterns. 
Design user interfaces – the interface is vital, user interaction aspects are designed during 
this stage. 

Design system interfaces – it allows communication between different software, therefore 
a design of specifications occurs. 
Design and integrate the database - database is designed and integrated into the new 
system. 
Prototype for design details – a functional prototype is designed. 
Design and integrate the system controls - the database and the application are protected 
due to the risk associated with technology and security.  

4. Implementation phase 
The new system is complete, tested, and installed. The system should be functioning and 
ready for use.  Users are trained to use the system and perform transactions. System 
evaluation is done to check if the system work properly (Satzinger, et al., 2009 & Tilley, 
2020). 
According to Satzinger, et al. ( 2009), there are five activities involved:  
Construct software components – different techniques are used in the construction of 
software. A specific language has to be chosen to write a program, that can be Java or 
C#.  
Verify and test – testing of the software is done to ensure that it works properly and meets 
the needs of the system user. 
Convert data – the information needed is converted into a format required by the new 
system. 
Train users and document the system – it is important for users to understand the system 
hence training is essential. 
Install the system – the program is installed into the equipment.

5. Support phase 
The phase focuses on ensuring that  the system continues running from the day it was 
initially installed. This only occurs after the system has been installed and used. Errors 
are fixed and enhancements are integrated into the system to maximize return (Satzinger, 
et al., 2009 & Tilley, 2020). 
 
According to Satzinger, et al. ( 2009), there are three activities involved: 
Maintain the system – maintenance of the system is continuous, this is to fix bugs and 
make adjustments. 
Enhance the system – Changes that occur must be integrated into the system and it is 
important to add new features to the system, however, the changes have to be approved 
first. 
Support the users – knowledgeable technicians should be available to assist users. 

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Agile model refers to software development based on iterative development where it break tasks into smaller iterations. The requirement are laid down from the start till the end. It consists of the duration and tasked to be performed and it is based on full software development lifecycle. This is basically the new way of programming (Swarnalath et. al, 2020).

Waterfall model 
Waterfall follows sequential method of developing project, it has a starting and ending point. it basically plans from beginning to end where each phose is completed before moving to the other and has a clear documentation but lacks flexibility for a change. Errors may be detected late (Pargaonkar, 2024). 

Differences
The agile model uses incremental and interative approach while waterfall model flows sequentially from start to end. There are individual models in agile and waterfall design processes are not broken into individual.Client can have an input and make changes into the programme several times while in production and testers work closely with developers however in waterfall the client sees the project once completed and testers do not work together with developers. Agile allows quick project implementation on small projects and can be difficult to estimate on large projects while in waterfall model estimation is done on any type of a project. Developers are not involved in planning process of waterfall model while they are invilved in agile model (Swarnalath et. al, 2020).

Agile model can be used on projects that need fleibility and customer engagement, these are projects that change overtime as they rely on continuous feedback. For an example web development.

while waterfall model can be used on a well defined and structure projects where they hardly change such as Government project.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

Requirement engineering plays an important role in software development as it focuses on discovery, documentation and maintenance requirement throughout the software development lifecycle. It consist of analysing needs of stakeholders, steps of developing the projects and ways to maintain it overtime then documentation of all the steps involved. 

The process involves four requirement
Elicitation - information collection about the design of the project from stakeholders involved.
Specification - elaboration of the requirements and implementation.
Verification and validation - verification of the requirements documented based on customer needs
Management - involves managing the changes that the client may needs and its documentation.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity is logical patitioning of software design that helps in managing complex software. It makes complex software to be manageble for benefots of implementation and maintenance (Mathew, 2007). The software is divided into modules which allows separate testing without affecting the other part. Debugging is done on each module rather the whole project, This is how modularity allows improvements on maintability. Scalability is improved through allowing teams to work on different modules while increasing performance. Load is distibuted in different servers allowing scalability.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Testing examines a software for any defects that can affect its functionality. It ensures that quality assurance is done to deluver reliable and stable software that meet the need of a client. It also improves the perfomance of the software.

Unit testing - testing of an individual module  before integation with other modules.
Integration testing - test the behaviour of modules, this is to identify errors that were not detected during unit testing.
Usability testing - there different  requirements, therefore this test is done many different times. It is to determine if a module, methos, class, subsytem or system meets user requirements.
Acceptance test - it tests to determine if the system can fulfil user requirement. This is the last stage of tesing before handover to client.


Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version contol system are softwares used to keep track of changes made to a computer program, it keeps note of who made the changes ans what changes were made.  They have the ability to hold the changes on queue until they are reviewed. This is to avoid problems that programmers can cause a result of working on same projects. They have the ability to pioint out the chnages that caused a problem. examples of version control systems includes github and gitlab (O'Shea, 2023).

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

Project manager has to keep each tem member motivated for the entire project and cater to each team member's needs.  Manager has to arrange team building activities  and apply creativity to promote tea building and build a stronger team. The manager has to create schedules, allocate resources and monitor progress of project. Risk is also managed by the manager, have to identify and mitigate any risk. 

Challenges
Communication - there should be a clear line of communication  among the team members and stakeholders.
resource allocation - resources have to be allocated properly from the beginning of the project. 
time management - meeting deadline can be challenging incase of unforseen circumstances. 
risk management - some risks cannot be easily identified and may impact project negatively


Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software maintanance is a process of changing system after it has been delivered. These can be coding errors, design change or enhancements to accomodate new requirements. Maintenance is important part of software development lifecycle since errors have to be corrected if there are any or chnasges have to be implemented. This stage may consume a lot of time in development. it keeps the software up to date, relevant and improve its performance (Agarwa, 2011). 

Types of maintenance activities
Fault repairs - coding errors, design errors
Enviromental adaptation - done when there are changes in system enviroment such as hardware or operating system.
Functional addition -  occurs when system has to change in response to business change

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Information privacy - large amount of data is collected and stored for different purposes. Leaking of the data can result in negative impact of an organisation. Data should be collected with a user consent
Transparancy -  Data collected should be used for the purpose specified to the user. Users should know how their data is used and stored. 
Accountability -  developers should account for any unfavourable results.

Software engineers need to ensure that they always adhare to code of ethics and continue reading on the ethical standards. Be honest with stakeholders.
